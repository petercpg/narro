#summary See here what happened lately

= (Mar 03) Sources are up =

The first import is available here: http://code.google.com/p/narro/source/browse/trunk/narro/?r=8 .
It's working, but installing would require some instructions. I'm planning an installer, so I don't want to bore you right now. 

Please stay tuned for a public release.

= (Feb 29) And we're off! =

Narro is now hosted on google. The sources will be submitted shortly.
